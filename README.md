In this paper, we propose a novel method for blackbox attacks via surrogate ensemble
search (BASES) that can generate highly successful blackbox attacks using an
extremely small number of queries. We first define a perturbation machine that
generates a perturbed image by minimizing a weighted loss function over a fixed
set of surrogate models. To generate an attack for a given victim model, we search
over the weights in the loss function using queries generated by the perturbation
machine. Since the dimension of the search space is small (same as the number of
surrogate models), the search requires a small number of queries.
